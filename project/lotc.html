			"<b>Page header</b><p>The first part shows the header's right side, which includes information such as 'sign in', 'sign up', 'cart', and 'favorites'. On mouse hover over each of those links, a white background with green text will take over that link.</p><p>The second part shows the header when a user is logged in. The first link is replaced with the user's username. The second link is for the user's personal store (if they have one). The cart's number of items will also update based on the user. When the user hovers over their username, a box will show under the link, which displays the user's profile image, username, account settings, and sign out.

It will basically show up to 3 products added to the cart. At the bottom, the message tells the user how many other items are in their cart. They can click on the button to go to their cart.</p>",
			"<b>Sign in/sign up</b><p>The left shows the 'sign in' page. The image above shows an error message that says 'password incorrect'. This happens after the user attempts to sign in to a registered email or phone number, but the password does not match. If the user enters an email or phone number not registered in the website, a respective message will show up for that as well.</p><p>The right shows the 'sign up' page. The image above shows an error message that says 'phone number has already been registered'. This happens after the user tries to register with a used phone number in the website. The first section asks for their 'full name' and 'username'. The bottom section asks the registration method (either by email or phone number or both).</p>",
			"<b>Account page (basic information)</b><p>Currently, the account page looks like this. The sidebar on the left still needs updating, but right now it has links to 'information', 'safety settings', 'my level', 'messages', and 'my orders'.</p><p>The right side displays the basic information for the current user. A message (if any) is displayed on the middle (the image reads 'signed in successfully'). The first heading displays the 'full name', 'username', and 'password'. The fields can be updated. The second heading displays the contact information: location, phone number, email, QQ, WeChat. The third section is an area for the user to add a short biography. Clicking on the button at the bottom will update all fields.</p>",
			"<b>Account page (upload image)</b><p>When the user clicks on the second tab, they get to upload a new profile image. Again, a message is displayed in the middle if there is any (the image reads 'profile image changed successfully'). The user has two options: choosing to upload a new image or use a previously used image. If the user selects to use a new image, they can choose from their computer, and that image will be displayed under it.</p><p>Should the user want to use a previously used image, they can select from the list. They can also remove the images by clicking on the 'x', too. The default image cannot be removed. Depending on the button clicked, the image of the user will be updated to the selected.</p>",
			"<b>Account page (messages)</b><p>This page shows the messages and conversations with other users on the website. According to the image above, the current user has only interacted with another user with the username 'Standard'. When the user clicks on the username of a user, the messages area will show the conversation.</p><p>Note: My method for making a chat-like page is rather inefficient, as it only stores each message (appended) to the database, so there does not seem to be any real-time messaging. I believe this could act as emailing each other, though. Currently, I made it that the user can read all messages from when they started the conversation, but I suppose removing messages earlier than 3 months can be implemented.</p>",
			"<b>Account page (my orders)</b><p>The user can access their order history on this page. Each order is separated with its purchased products. For each order, the order date, the order number, and the store name is displayed. Because I was inspired from Alibaba Taobao, the entire order selected will be split into different orders based on the store.</p><p>For each product, the image, name (and variations if any), price and quantity, and a 'review' button is shown. The total price is also shown. The rightmost column reads 'order information' and 'track package' actions.</p>",
			"<b>Cart page</b><p>The user can check the first checkbox (reads 'select all') to select all items. The user can select the checkbox on the store name line to check all products added to the cart from that store, or they can individually select the products to check out for the timebeing.</p><p>For each store, the product image, name, quantity, price, total price, and actions are shown on each row. The user can click on the '-' and '+' buttons to decrement/increment the quantity or type in a number. The cart contents will be updated to the database, and the total cost will be updated on the page. The user can click on 'move to favorites' or 'delete' from the actions column. A big textarea is shown, which is used if the user wants to send a message to the seller.</p><p>At the bottom, the user can click on 'select all' again (the bar is sticked to the page). The number of products selected will be shown, and the total cost of everything for this order will be calculated. The user can click on the 'checkout' button to checkout.</p><p>Note: For the scope of the project, I did not implement actual transactions taking place. Clicking on the button will just send the data to the database and record it as a finished order.</p>",
			"<b>Search page</b><p>As of now, the search page is the most important page, as it allows users to search for existing products. However, it is also the page that still needs fixing and updating. Right now, it is only displaying the only 5 products I added to the website. The only thing that is working is entering a search query that contains something on the product title. The user can also navigate between pages, but there is too few products on the website to have it work.</p><p>Note: The search bar at the top of the page is actually shown on every page. However, for the purpose of the search page, I included this in the screenshot.</p>",
			"<b>Search page (delivery address)</b><p>If the user clicks on the 'delivery address' label or the input field on the search page, a box will appear below it. The user can select the provinces in China, which then directs the user to the next tab to select the city, and finally the district. The user cannot skip to the next tab if nothing is selected, but they can go back to previous tabs. Some provinces do not have cities and or some cities do not have districts, so the box will simply close and the input field will be updated.</p>",
			"<b>Product page</b><p>The product page is one of the most important pages, as the purpose of the project is an e-commerce website, so it must display the products. The image above shows what the product page currently looks. The user can click on the images for the product and the larger image will be updated to the respective one.</p><p>On the right, the user can see the product title, the store selling the product, and the overall rating for the product. On the gray box, the original price is crossed out, in this case, because the product is on sale. The sale price is shown in large text. Under the sale price is the 'coupons' area (only appears if the product has coupons). The coupon name would be in the center of the dotted red boxes (I just did not add a name to it).</p><p>Below the gray box is the place for variations and quantity. For this particular product, it has variations of 'color' and 'size'. When the page is first loaded, none is selected. Depending on what the user selects, the 'stock' is updated. The image shows 37 stocked for blue-M. A box is disabled and dotted if there is no stock for that. For the image example, there is no black color for the size M. However, if we click on S, there may be black color stock. If all black color sizes are not in stock, the user just cannot click on black. If all XS size colors are not in stock, the user just cannot click on XS.</p><p>The user can type in a quantity (will automatically be replaced as the max stock quantity if the number entered is greater than max) or click on the arrows. The user can click 'immediately purchase' or 'add to cart' buttons. On the bottom, the 'reviews' tab is selected. It displays all the reviews available for the current product. The 'product information' tab will simply display the customized text for the product.</p>",
			"<b>Add product page</b><p>A seller can add a product to the website. The above shows all the required fields, such as 'title', 'images', 'number', etc. Currently, the seller can only upload 5 images for the product (may add more). The user can also select the 'category', which then prompts the user to select a 'sub-category'.</p><p>The website will also allow the seller to add up to 2 variations. They can select a variation category, of which include 'color', 'size', 'style', 'material', 'shape', or 'other' (will prompt seller to enter a name for the variation). They can add the different names (up to 20) for the variations under it, such as 'white' and 'black'. They must click on the red text button to confirm their variations because it will create the table for SKU, price, and quantity.</p><p>Lastly, the user can add tags that help users better search for the product. They can also provide a customized description for the product that will be displayed on the product page.</p>"
